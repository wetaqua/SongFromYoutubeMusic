1. Add web source into OBS (or other streaming software), select "from file" and choose now_playing.html
2. RUN app.py (you need to have installed flask and flask_cors) 
3. Then use Tampermonky (or other extension) to run script.js in music.youtube.com (script.js can also be pasted into console manualy)

Troubleshooting:
1. AdBlock can block fetch, try disabling it
2. Make sure you have python installed, and have flask and flask_cors in virtual environment or downloaded to computer
